Sometimes after an event you need to issue certificates to the participants. 
How do you normally produce several certificates automatically? There are 
different ways to do it and here we share our approach after a recent community 
event[^1]. We used R to automatically generate the certificates using R 
markdown and LaTeX language.

## Objective

The key objective was to produce PDF certificates that could be emailed to 
attendees.

## How did it work?

We started with a certificate template in R markdown format (with LateX) containing 
the following tags `<<ATTENDEE_NAME>>`, `<<EVENT_NAME>>`, `<<EVENT_DATE>>` and
`<<EVENT_LOCATION>>`. These tags were replaced by attendee and event information 
from a `data.frame`. ` The PDF certificates were produced using rmarkdown::render()`
whilst looping over the attendee `data.frame`.

## Requirements

1. A fixed working directory using `set_here()`[^2].

2. Dataset with attendee and event (name, date and location) information.

3. A certificate template in R markdown format.

## Set up

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rmarkdown)
library(stringr)
library(here)

set_here() # Need this later especially when rendering R markdown
```


## Dataset of Attendees

Let assume that our dataset of attendees is as follow:
```{r attendeeData, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# Read in the attendee data
attendees <- read_csv("AttendeeList.csv") %>%
  mutate(filePDF = str_c("PDF/", row_number(), "_",
                         str_replace_all(Name, fixed(" "), "_"), ".pdf")) %>%
  select(filePDF, Name, Event, Date, Location)
attendees
```

## Summary

We have presented a way to create PDF certificates of attendance based on a user 
defined "template". The template was populated with the attendee and event 
information from which PDF certificates were genereated using R markdown. Our 
code can be run directly from the `R` console or as a batch job thanks to the
`rmarkdown` and `here` packages.
