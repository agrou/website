Welcome to **DSup** community! **:o)**

This group focus is on "Data Science Thinking", in an informal and relaxed manner.

Why "Unplugged"?
When we unplug the tools (e.g. R, python) and the buzzwords (e.g. machine learning, big data) we are left with Data Science in its rawest form to build on. Starting with this core, we want to encourage Data Science thinking through creative and innovative activities.

**DS Unplugged Objectives:**

* Encourage Data Science thinking.

* Share experiences, knowledge and skills.

* Promote good practices, tools and methods through openness and transparency.

* Make Lisbon & Portugal a hub for Data Science.

This meetup is open to all programming languages used in data science.

**Come and enjoy Data Science with us.**
